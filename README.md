# Algorithm Implementations

This project includes the implementation of most common algorithms and data stractures

## Algorithms

### Union find path compression

- Union operation: connect two objects
- Find operation: check whther given two objects are connected
- Path compression is effecient algorithm
  - Time complexity
    - Find `O(log(n))`
    - Union `O(log(n))`
