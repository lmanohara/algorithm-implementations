# Algorithm Implementations

This project includes the implementation of most common algorithms and data stractures

## Algorithms

### Union find path compression

- Union operation: connect two objects
- Find operation: check whether given two objects are connected
    - Time complexity
        - Find `O(log(n))`
        - Union `O(log(n))`

### Stack data structure
- Push operation: add item into the stack
- Pop operation: remove item from the stack
  - Time complexity
    - Push `O(1)`
    - Pop `O(1)`
